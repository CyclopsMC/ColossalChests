As always, don't forget to backup your world before updating!
Requires CyclopsCore version 0.11.0 or higher.

Changes:
* Update zh_CN.lang

Fixes:
* Fix occasional client crash when opening chest guis, Closes #101
  This was because indexing would occur client=side as well, which is not required and not properly supported, and thus could result in crashes.
